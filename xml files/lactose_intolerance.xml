            Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in the milk of all mammals. Most lactose intolerance is in adults, but some infants also suffer from lactose intolerance. There are at least 4 distinct SNPs that determine lactose tolerance, one of which is found primarily in European populations, and three found primarily in African populations.
