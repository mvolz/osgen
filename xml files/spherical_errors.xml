           Spherical errors are refractive errors where the image is focused either in front or behind the retina, making the image blurry. Spherical errors include myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness).

            <description>Spherical errors contribute to the degree (severity) of myopia (nearsightedness) and hyperopia (farsightedness). Diopters are units that describe the degree of myopia and hyperopia. A negative diopter value means nearsighted and a positive diopter value means farsighted. </description>
